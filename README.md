# CloseCall: pipeline for processing RNA-RNA proximity data

CloseCall is a bioinformatics pipeline for identifying RNA-RNA interactions in NGS datasets generated using a new high-throughput protocol named Proximity RNA-seq to fix and sequence RNA complexes. The CloseCall pipeline has 3 main components:
1) Mapping and QC
2) Monte Carlo Simulation to identify statistically significant RNA-RNA interactions

The software is written in Perl and Java.


## Documentation
The CloseCall documentation can be found with the code in the [docs](docs) subfolder and can also read online.
