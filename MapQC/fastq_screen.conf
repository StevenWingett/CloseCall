## Databases #
##############
## This section allows you to configure multiple databases
## to search against in your screen.  For each database
## you need to provide a database name (which can't contain
## spaces) and the location of the bowtie indices which 
## you created for that database.
## 
## The default entries shown below are only suggested examples
## you can add as many DATABASE sections as you like, and you
## can comment out or remove as many of the existing entries
## as you like.
##
## To use Bowtie2 instead of the original Bowtie, add 
## 'BOWTIE2' after the path to the indices basename.
## For example:
## DATABASE	Human	/data/public/Genomes/Human/GRCh37/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37 BOWTIE2


##########
##Human
DATABASE 	Human 	/bi/scratch/Genomes/Human/GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38

##########
##Human_Repeats - Ensembl NMasked
DATABASE 	Human_Repeats 	/bi/home/wingetts/anaconda/Data/human_repeats
